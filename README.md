# What is UUID?
- Hey there! A UUID stands for "Universally Unique Identifier". It's like a special code that is used to identify something or someone in a computer program or system. It's called "universally unique" because it's very, very unlikely that two things will have the same UUID. It's kind of like each thing or person gets their own special ID number that's different from everyone else's.<br/>

- Just like how each person has a unique name or ID number, computer programs and systems use UUIDs to keep track of things in a way that's organized and easy to manage. So, a UUID is a special code that helps computers keep track of different things in a really precise way. <br/>
